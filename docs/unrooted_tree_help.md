An unrooted phylogeny (newick treefile) containing all the sequences to be calibrated or dated. Tip labels must exactly match the sequence IDs in info CSV file. The tree should be inferred from plasma-derived HIV RNA sequences collected over at least 3 time points prior to therapy initiation as well as HIV sequences collected from the reservoir. The latter may comprise of proviral sequences collected during suppressive therapy or HIV sequences sampled following treatment discontinuation (under the assumption that these represent sequences emerging from the reservoir)
