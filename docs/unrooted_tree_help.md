An unrooted phylogeny (newick tree file) containing all the sequences to be calibrated or dated. The tree should be inferred from calibration collected over at least 3 time points as well as the query sequences. The former may comprise plasma-derived HIV RNA collected during prior to therapy initation and the latter may comprise of proviral sequences collected during suppressive therapy or HIV sequences sampled following treatment discontinuation (under the assumption that these represent sequences emerging from the reservoir).
\* Tip labels must exactly match sequence IDs in the info CSV file.
