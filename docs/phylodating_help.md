Phylodating estimates unknown sequence ages from a phylogenetic tree inferred from longitudinally derived sequences ("calibration sequences") and sequences with unknown ages ("query sequences"). Calibration sequences are used to calibrate a linear regression relating their root-to-tip distances with their sampling times, which is then used to estimate the establishment dates of the query sequences. The methodology is based on:

Jones, B. R., et al. (2018) Phylogenetic approach to recover integration dates of latent HIV sequences within-host. PNAS 115 (38): E8958-E8967. doi: [10.1073/pnas.1802028115](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1802028115).

To estimate integration dates of HIV reservoir sequences, you must provide two files. First, you must provide an unrooted phylogenetic tree inferred from plasma-derived HIV RNA sequences collected over at least 3 time points prior to therapy initiation as well as HIV sequences collected from the reservoir.  The latter may comprise proviral sequences collected during suppressive therapy or HIV sequences sampled following treatment discontinuation (under the assumption that these represent sequences emerging from the reservoir). Second you must provide an "info" CSV file listing each sequence in the phylogeny, its sampling date, and specifying whether the sequence should be treated as "calibration" (i.e. data used to calibrate the linear regression; coded as "0") or "query" (sequences for which date estimation is required; coded as "1").  As mentioned above, "calibration" data usually represent longitudinal plasma HIV RNA sequences collected prior to therapy while query data are sequences sampled from the reservoir.  Note that collection date is required for all sequences, even query data, if you want to generate the divergence versus time plot.

Details of the two files are required by Phylodating (`info.csv` and `unrooted_tree.nwk`) are given below.
