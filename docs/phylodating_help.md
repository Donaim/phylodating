Phylodating estimates unknown sequence ages from a phylogenetic tree inferred from longitudinally derived sequences ("input sequences") and sequences with unknown ages ("query sequences"). Input sequences are used to calibrate a linear regression relating their root-to-tip distances with their sampling times, which is then used to estimate the establishment dates of the query sequences. The methodology is based on:

Two files are required by Phylodating (`info.csv` and `unrooted_tree.nwk`). Details are given below.
