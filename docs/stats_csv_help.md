A comma separated file that contains information about the linear regression including the dAIC, representing the difference between the Akaike Information Criteria of the null model (where the regressionâ€™s slope is zero) and the linear regression inferred from the data, the Estimated Root Date (with 95% confidence interval), the Estimated Evolutionary Rate and the Model Fit (the model fit is designated as 1 if the linear regression passes both predefined quality control criteria (dAIC > 10, and the lower bound of the 95% confidence interval of the estimated root date precedes the earliest collection date) and 0 otherwise).
