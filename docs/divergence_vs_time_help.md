A graphic relating root-to-tip divergence of the sequences versus their collection dates. Black circles represent calibration sequences and red diamonds represent query sequences. The blue dotted line denotes the linear regression and the grey lines denote the ancestral (phylogenetic) traces. An example plot is shown below.

*Will only be generated if the regression fits and all tip dates are given.*
