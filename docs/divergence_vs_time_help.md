A graphic relating root-to-tip divergence of the sequences versus their collection dates. Black circles represent input (plasma) sequences and red diamonds represent query (reservoir) sequences.  The blue dotted line denotes the linear regression and the grey lines denote the ancestral traces. An example of the plot is shown below.
