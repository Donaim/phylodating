A comma separated file containing the collection dates of the sequences. The file must contain a header with the 3 columns:

1. ID: the sequence IDs, exactly matching the tip labels of the unrooted tree.
2. Date: collection date in the format yyyy-mm-dd (e.g. 2018-09-18).
3. Query: 0 if the sequence is to be used to calibrate the linear regression, and 1 otherwise. Usually, pre-therapy plasma HIV sequences are coded as "0" and HIV reservoir sequences are coded as "1".
